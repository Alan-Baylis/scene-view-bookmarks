# Scene View Bookmarks

Unity editor extension to bookmark scene views.


## Huh?

Unreal Engine has a [handy feature](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_i-d5OZmhWI) that allows you to bookmark the viewport camera's current position then return to it later. Unity lacks this convenience, but this script adds it.


## Using

Drop `SceneViewBookmarker` into your Unity project. Press <kbd>option / alt</kbd> and a number from 1-9 to bookmark the current scene view. When you want to return to the scene view that you bookmarked, press <kbd>shift</kbd> and the number you chose.

After recalling a bookmark, you can return to the former scene view by pressing <kbd>shift</kbd> <kbd>0</kbd> (think of this as an undo of sorts).
